# Deep-Similarity
Image Similarity is a well investigated problem over the last decades. There are many ways to
encounter the problem (Rui, Huang, & Chang, 1999), that is a joint work of database management
and computer vision communities. Recent works take use of Deep Learning methods, that has been
proven to handle image representation very well. Deep Neural Networks are used for variety of tasks
including image recognition, natural language text and audio processing, that showed a signicant
progress with this approach, comparing to other techniques.
In this review we shall focus on resemblance of images based on their feature vectors, using Deep
Learning methods for the feature extraction task and discuss the challenges.
The outline is as follow: First we focus on a specic method with a specic dataset (Wang et al.,
2014), Then we take the acknowledgements from previous step and test it on the targeted data we
received from the client.
